# Pendo Product Style Guide

Having a single product voice is a vital part of creating an enjoyable product experience. Creating a single product voice requires partnership from everyone communicating with our customers in product copy and content. This style guide describes the standards for writing and creating content using the Pendo product voice.

We have design standards for articles and guides to promote consistency for end users and make content creation easier for content creators. The Templates section describes the requirements for layouts and formating of different types of content in detail.

Teams at Pendo are continuously innovating and developing new strategies for engaging and helping our users. These programs occassionally require deviation from our designs and voice recommendations. The Appendix section contains guidance for creating unique content for each of these specific programs.
