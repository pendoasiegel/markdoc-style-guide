This page provides a template for articles written to help readers complete a task. These articles typically include:

-   Context for how the task fits into the overall workflow.

-   At least one [**procedural section**](https://pendo-io.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2840756573/Templates+and+writing+guidance#Procedural-instructions). Group multiple related procedures into a single article unless there's a reason not to.

-   Informational content, especially in the overview. For more guidance, see [**Informational content**](/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2843083168).

For more information on content types and how they fit together, see [**Combining content types**](https://pendo-io.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2840756573/Templates+and+writing+guidance#Combining-content-types). For guidance on style, see [**General writing guidelines**](https://pendo-io.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2840756573/Templates+and+writing+guidance#General-writing-guidelines) in the [**Templates and writing guidance**](/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2840756573)parent page.

Structure
=========

For more information on the individual elements of an article, see [**Elements**](https://pendo-io.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2840756573/Templates+and+writing+guidance#Elements)in [**Templates and writing Guidance**](/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2840756573).

-   **Title:**

    -   Use a descriptive title based on the primary purpose of the document.

    -   Use active and specific verbs.

    -   Describe the task contained within the article, but be general enough to reflect all of the content.

    -   If a document is primarily a tutorial, write a task-based title, even if it has a conceptual introduction.

    -   Describe the feature itself, agnostic to what setting the reader chooses. For example, "Set roadmap visibility" rather than "Make your roadmap private".

-   **Subtitle or initial paragraph:** Introductory and conceptual information, such as what the article is about, a feature description, what the expected outcome is, and an overview of the article content. For information on writing conceptual content, see the page on [**Informational content**](/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2843083168).

-   **Prerequisites and limitations:** Whether there are any downloads, installations, third-party components, or storage/speed/connectivity/hosting requirements. For information on this and other types of referential content, see the page on [**Informational content**](/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2843083168).

-   **Procedural steps by task:**

    -   A walkthrough of the individual steps that the user must take to complete the task set out in this article. See [**Procedural instructions**](https://pendo-io.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2840756573/Templates+and+writing+guidance#Procedural-instructions)for more information.

    -   If there is more than one task/activity involved, provide instructions for each task as they would occur in the ideal workflow (find, create, edit, remove). The last task is typically the most destructive one, such as deleting or restarting something. For example:

        -   Procedural content for enabling or creating a feature or setting (such as creating a roadmap).

        -   Procedural content on using a feature (such as finding an existing roadmap).

        -   Procedural content on managing a feature or setting (such as adding to a roadmap.

        -   Procedural content on disabling a feature or setting (such as making a roadmap private).

        -   Procedural content on destructive actions (such as deleting a roadmap).

        -   Troubleshooting information

-   **Known issues and troubleshooting (if applicable):** Descriptions of common barriers and solutions for fixing these issues. See [**Troubleshooting** **content**](/wiki/spaces/~313172851/pages/2841149448)for more information.

-   **Next steps (if applicable):** An indication of what the user might be interested in doing next or where else they might want to go in the documentation.

-   **FAQs (if applicable):** Popular, recent, or important topics to highlight.

<What your feature allows you to do>. [E.g., Pendo Feedback offers different table views of request data to support your Feedback activities.]

OR

With <feature>, you can <benefit to the customer, administrator, or end-user, as appropriate>. [E.g., With status updates, users can quickly see what's happening with their requests at a high level.]

PLUS

<**Relevant** and **necessary** background information.> [E.g., former names, a definition, options depending on customer type.]

### <Prerequisites>

<List what the reader needs to know about the feature, such as whether there are any storage, speed, or connectivity requirements, limitations, access prerequisites, and whether there are any downloads, installations, or 3rd party configurations they need>

Example
=======

Below is a simplified example of how the above template might be used.

Product Areas in Pendo Feedback [Title, H1]
-------------------------------------------

You can sort and filter your Pendo Feedback requests by **Product Areas** (formerly Groups) in your app. Product Areas provide you with the context needed for a quick way of viewing, processing, and prioritizing relevant Feedback requests.

Product Areas in Pendo Feedbackare an extension of the Product Areas functionality in Pendo Engage (formerly, Insights and Guidance).

A Product Area refers to a section or feature in your app. Product Areas are used as categories that help you organize your Pendo Feedback requests. If you have a multi-app subscription, you can also filter by **App**.

### Roles and permissions [H2]

If you don't want Product Areas to be visible to Visitors in your app, you can set the visibility to **Team Only**. This restricts Product Area functionality to internal Pendo Feedback users only. If you select **Team & Visitors**, Product Areas will be visible to both internal teams and Visitors in your app. Product Areas that can be seen by both Team users and Visitors display the following icon in the **Product Areas** dropdown menu when submitting or editing a request: <icon>

### View Product Areas [H2]

To view a list of all existing Product Areas, select **Settings > Product Settings > Product Areas** from the left-side menu. If you're also an **Insights and Guidance** customer, you see Product Areas for both Pendo Feedback and Pendo Insights and Guidance.

### Create a Product Area [H2]

You must be a Feedback Administratorto create a Product Area. To add a your list of Product Areas:

1.  In Pendo Feedback, select **Settings > Product Settings > Product Areas** from the left-side menu.

2.  Open the Product Areas management list by selecting the **Create/Edit in Pendo Settings** link in the top right corner.

3.  Select **+ Create Product Area**

4.  Enter the following information in the **Create Product Area** form:

    -   A meaningful display name for the Product Area.

    -   The color you want to assign to the Product Area.

    -   If on a multi-app subscription, the app that the Product Area belongs to.

    -   The visibility of the Product Area.

5.  Select **Create Product Area**.

Once you've created a custom Feedback View, you can save it by selecting **Save** in the top right corner. This opens a **Create New View** window, where you're prompted to enter a meaningful name for your custom view.

Only internal team members can see saved views; app visitors don't have access to them. If you want to make your custom view private, select **Only Me** under **Visibility**. If you choose **Everyone**, your saved custom view becomes visible to your coworkers.

Select **Confirm** at the bottom of the window to save your custom view. 

### Edit or delete a Product Area [H2]

You must be a Feedback Administrator to modify Product Areas. To edit a Product Area:

1.  In Pendo Feedback, select **Settings > Product Settings > Product Area**s from the left-side menu.

2.  Open the Product Areas management list by selecting the **Create/Edit in Pendo Settings** link in the top right corner.

3.  Hover over the Product Area you want to edit and select the edit icon.

4.  In the **Edit Product Area** modal that appears, make changes to the Product Area.

5.  To save your changes, selec**t Edit Product Area**.

You can also delete the Product Area from this modal. Alternatively, hover the Product Area you want to delete in the Product Areas management list and select the trash icon.

You can only delete a Product Area if it isn't being used by any other items, such as existing requests, or by Insights and Guidance. If you attempt to delete a Product Area that has requests assigned to it in Pendo Feedback, or that has Features, Pages, Track Events, or Guides assigned to it in Pendo Insights and Guidance, you will be presented with a message that tells you can't delete the Product Area and the number of items that use it.
