# Overview

Many of the specific writing rules in the [Pendo Brand Voice and Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NA5n3Ac5lWPzANcUE7vVbaYnEcP1fDpkNK6RB7fpFlQ/edit#slide=id.g10f0d2d600c_0_1) and Pendo's guidance for Brand Copywriting are good practice for help documentation and UX writing.

We've put together the following additional guidance based on established content design principles, cognitive psychology, UX writing guidelines, and industry standards.

Other good sources of guidance, if this style guide is ever lacking, are the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/lists) and [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

We also have a [shareable slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZUj_H7fWqGOwlQepEEc1WC2Rg7IXpHAYjbWZJlRGMLQ/edit?usp=sharing) that summarizes the main rules you need to follow for writing help documentation.

## Who are we and what do we do?

We are technical writers. Technical writers are concerned with designing the digital experience of product information––how information is formed, organized, delivered, and presented.

The aim is to optimize how people engage with information to maximize the user experience (UX) of a product and guide them towards success. To this end, we are responsible for:

* **Help Center Content.** We write and maintain technical content for Pendo’s products, and champion good documentation practices. This involves synching with Engineering, Design, and PMs to align content with feature releases and updates, and organizing this content around a meaningful and cohesive information architecture.

* **UX Writing.** Where appropriate, we contribute to UI review and in-product content development, such as error messages and microcopy. We can also help with terminology, structure, layout, labeling, word choice, and copy for other UI elements, such as buttons, text fields, input controls, navigation, text links, and so on.

* **IGST.** We belong to the IGST, which stands for “Internal Guide Swat Team”. We review Guides for approval before they go live to customers. This helps us keep style consistent, maximize the effectiveness of the messaging, and prevent overlapping Guides.


## What is the Style Guide for?

We want to ensure that information is meaningful, accurate, user-friendly, and formatted appropriately, whether that’s part of help documentation or in the product itself. Following a set of writing guidelines helps ensure consistency, content quality, and a good user experience of help documentation and UI content.

The ProdOps Style Guide isn’t a complete list of every language, grammar, or formatting rule and convention. The style guide is designed to deal with common scenarios and to recommend best practices for help documentation and in-product content.
