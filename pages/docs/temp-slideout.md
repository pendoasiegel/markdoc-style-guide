## Education Slideout Guide ##
This guide provides a large format open layout for presenting a range of instructional content. The intent is for these guides to deploy from a single "Education and Troubleshooting" guide list module in the resource center. Each customer-facing team can have their own slideout guide presenting their content. The guide can use building blocks to present text, launch guides, link to external resources, and present a video or image.
